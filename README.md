## üìñ About the Project

The **Green Flights** project is a landing page concept for a modern, fictional airline. The idea was to create a clean, attractive, and high-performance interface, focusing on a fluid and pleasant user experience.

The main objective was to apply and deepen my knowledge in the following areas:
* **Development with Next.js:** Utilizing its structure for optimized rendering and SEO.
* **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** Creating a custom and responsive design system in an agile manner.
* **Animations with Framer Motion:** Adding micro-interactions and animations that bring the page to life and enhance navigation.
